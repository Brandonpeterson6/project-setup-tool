# Legendary Journey

Here we have our group Project of a Calendar invite

## Description

This project shows a convenient way to schedule a meeting with someone. You can use your name, phone number, email, pick a date, and send a message about your meeting with this simple card. This card will automatically show up in your Trello once you submit and will put the meeting directly into your Trello calendar.

## Getting Started

Simply add the contact information and a small message about your meeting into the given boxes. You’ll next want to pick your meeting date. Click submit and the rest is taken care of for you with the code that’s been written.
